# Probability and Statistics

This project is designed to explore different probability distribution functions and statistical techniques by implementing them in code. The code includes examples of MVU (Minimum Variance Unbiased) estimators for Gaussian, Rayleigh, and Poisson distributions.

## Project URL
The code for this project can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/ritikjain51/Probability-and-Statistics).

## Requirements
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Usage
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/ritikjain51/Probability-and-Statistics.git`
2. Install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Navigate to the directory of interest and run the desired code file.
